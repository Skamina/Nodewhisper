What is NodeWhisper?

NodeWhisper is a modular, open-source blockchain forensic intelligence platform. It’s designed to trace tokens and NFTs, cluster wallets, monitor suspicious activity, and generate forensic reports — all with transparency, flexibility, and real-time capabilities.

This project is in early development, but we’re building in public and actively seeking collaborators, researchers, and builders to shape it.
